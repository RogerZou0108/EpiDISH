\title{A method that allows the identification of differentially methylated 
cell-types and their directionality of change}
\usage{
CellDMC(beta.m, pheno.v, frac.m, adjPMethod = "fdr", adjPThresh = 0.05,
  cov.mod = NULL, sort = FALSE, mc.cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta.m}{A beta value matrix with rows labeling the CpGs and columns labeling 
samples. This contains all CpGs, from which you want to find DMCTs.}

\item{pheno.v}{A vector of phenotype. CellDMC can handle both of binary and 
continuous/oderinal phenotypes. \code{NA} is not allowed in
\code{pheno.v}.}

\item{frac.m}{A matrix contains fractions of each cell-type. Each row labels a sample, 
with the same order of the columns in beta.m. Each column labels a 
cell-type. Column names, which are names of cell-types, are required. The 
rowSums of frac.m should be 1, and all values should be greater than 0 and 
less than 1.}

\item{adjPMethod}{A method to adjust p values. The method can be any of method accepted by 
\code{\link{p.adjust}}.}

\item{adjPThresh}{A numeric value, default as 0.05. This is used to call significant DMCTs. 
Adjusted p values less than this threshold will be picked.}

\item{cov.mod}{A design matrix from \code{model.matrix}, which contains other covariates to
be adjusted. For example, input 
\code{model.matrix(~ geneder, data = pheno.df)} to adjust gender. Do not put
 cell-type fraction here!}

\item{sort}{Default as \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the data.frame in coe list will 
sorted based on p value of each CpG.}

\item{mc.cores}{The number of cores to use, i.e. at most how many child processes will be 
run simultaneously. The defatul is 1, which means no parallelization.}
}
\value{
A list with the following two items.

dmct
A matrix tells wheter the input CpGs are DMCTs and DMCs. The first column 
gives whether a CpG is DMC or not. If the CpG is called as DMC, the value 
will be 1, otherwise it is 0. The following columns give DMCTs for each 
cell-types. If a CpG is DMCT, the value will be 1 (hypermethylated for case 
compared to control) or -1 (hypomethylated for case compared to control). 
Otherwise, the value is 0 (non-DMCT). The rows of this matrix are ordered as
the same as input \code{beta.m}.

coe
This list contains several dataframe, which corresponds to each cel-type in
 \code{frac.m}. Each dataframe contains all CpGs in input \code{beta.m}. 
 All dataframes contain estimated DNAm differences(\code{Delta}), 
 estimated t statistics(\code{t}), 
 raw P values(\code{p}), and multiple hypothesis corrected P 
 values(\code{adjP}).

\description{
An outstanding challenge of Epigenome-Wide Association Studies performed in 
complex tissues is the identification of the specific cell-type(s) 
responsiblefor the observed differential methylation. CellDMC a novel 
statistical algorithm, which is able to identify not only differentially 
methylated positions, but also the specific cell-type(s) driving the 
differential methylation.

\examples{
data(centEpiFibIC.m)
data(DummyBeta.m)
out.l <- epidish(DummyBeta.m, centEpiFibIC.m, method = 'RPC')
frac.m <- out.l$estF
pheno.v <- factor(rep(c(0, 1), each = 5))
celldmc.o <- CellDMC(DummyBeta.m, pheno.v, frac.m) 
# Pls note this is faked beta value matrix
